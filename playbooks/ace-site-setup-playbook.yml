# https://github.com/SU-SWS/ansible-playbooks
# ============================================================================
#
# This playbook will create a new site in Acquia Cloud Enterprise, and
# (optionally) add a vhost as a custom domain in ACSF.
#
# Can be run with: ansible-playbook -i inventory/sites acsf-site-setup-playbook.yml
#
# SEE ALSO:
#
# full-migration-playbook.yml to create a new site on ACSF and sync from the
# existing infrastructure.
#
# migration-sync-only-playbook.yml to run the download and syncing tasks,
# given the site is already set up on ACSF.
#
# post-db-restore-playbook.yml to only run the tasks that happen after the ACSF
# site has been restored from the database dump.
#
# add-vhost-playbook.yml if you wish only to add a vhost as a custom domain.
