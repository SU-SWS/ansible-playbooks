# Ansible role for downloading the database and files from Sites.
# https://github.com/SU-SWS/ansible-playbooks
# ===============================================================
#
# This role saves a copy of the site database and files from Sites to your
# local directory in /tmp. I would call this a TASK role, since we don't know
# what state your directory and files might be in. But they should exactly
# match what's on Sites.
