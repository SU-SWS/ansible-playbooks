# Ansible playbook that recreates in Site Factory sites on our infrastructure.
# https://github.com/SU-SWS/ansible-playbooks
# ============================================================================
#
# This playbook will create a new site in Acquia Cloud Site Factory, and
# then sync a site from the SWS legacy hosting platform to the newly created
# site.
#
# Can be run with: ansible-playbook -i inventory/sites migration-playbook.yml
#
# RE-STARTING:
# If you need to restart the full site-migration process, restart from the top.
#
# Dependencies are not run when you restart a playbook with --start-at-task=""
# so you may miss requiring variables or operations on the files,
# site, and database.
#
# SEE ALSO:
#
# acsf-site-setup-playbook.yml to only run the roles that set up the site on
# ACSF.
#
# migration-sync-only-playbook.yml to run the download and syncing tasks,
# given the site is already set up on ACSF.
#
# post-db-restore-playbook.yml to only run the tasks that happen after the ACSF
# site has been restored from the database dump.
#
# add-vhost-playbook.yml if you wish only to add a vhost as a custom domain.
